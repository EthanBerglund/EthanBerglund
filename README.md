- 👋 Hi, I’m @EthanBerglund!
- 👀 I’m interested in hardware mainly, but I do enjoy programming and the software side of things. On the non-technical side, I love tabletop gaming, martial arts, and beekeeping! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Batch, Bash, and Basic for my work as an NPI Engineer. Personally, I'm working on learning Python, Android Development, and Javascript, just for kicks, ya know? 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but I'm open to ideas!
- 📫 You can reach me on LinkedIn, at https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanberglund/
